## How to deploy a vite app github pages

- go to `vite.config.ts` and set the `base` property to the name of your repo:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/canvas-confetti/',
  plugins: [react()],
})
```

- run `npm run build`

- add dist folder to git: `git add dist -f`

> Note: the -f flag is needed because the dist folder is ignored by default

- commit: `git commit -m "add dist"`
- push to gh-pages: `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`

> Note: This command pushes the contents of the "dist" folder to the "gh-pages" branch of the remote Git repository named "origin", using Git Subtree.
>
> More specifically, the git subtree push command is used to update a subtree of a Git repository with the changes made in another repository. In this case, the "dist" folder is treated as a subtree of the main repository, and the changes made to it will be pushed to the "gh-pages" branch of the "origin" repository.
>
> The --prefix dist option specifies the prefix path for the subtree to be pushed, which in this case is "dist". Finally, the "gh-pages" branch is typically used for hosting web pages on GitHub Pages, so this command may be used to update a website hosted on GitHub Pages with the contents of the "dist" folder.
